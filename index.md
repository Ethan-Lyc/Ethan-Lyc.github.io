# Biography

I'm Yicheng Liao, currently pursuing my first year as a master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology.I'm actively diving deeper into system programming, keen to blend my foundational knowledge with cutting-edge innovations. Eager to contribute and make an impact, I'm looking for opportunities to apply my skills and learn in dynamic tech environments.
I'm a life-long self-taught student. I learned most of my CS knowledge from online resources (courses, books), which shape me into who I am today. 

I'm expected to graduate from Georgia Institute of Technology in Winter 2024.
